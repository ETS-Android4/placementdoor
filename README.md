 <h2>Description</h2>

- Firebase Authentication for Login & SignUp :Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service provider (Baas). It offers a number of tools and services to developers to help them create high-quality apps, expand their user base, and profit. It is based on the infrastructure of Google. Firebase is a NoSQL database application that saves data in JSON-like documents. We used the firebase db in the placementdoor app to do user login and registration. When you enter your username and password, it is sent to the db and validated.
- Linear Layout:LinearLayout is a view group that aligns all children vertically or horizontally in a single direction. The android:orientation attribute can be used to indicate the layout direction.
- Spinner: A view that shows one child at a time and allows the user to choose from among them. The Spinner objects are drawn from the Adapter linked with this view.
- ListView: Displays a collection of views that may be scrolled vertically, with each view positioned exactly below the preceding item in the list.
- TextView(Used to Display Text),Button(Used to perform an action),EditText(Used to take input from user),ImageView(Used to Display Image)
- Event Listeners 
  - Action_DIAL(Open the user phone page with the number in the section,where user can simply click on the button and a call will be made to said  person)
  - OnCreate :Specifies the action that needs to be performed when an item is created
  - OnItemClick : Specifies the action that needs to be performed when an item is clicked
- Scroll View: A view group that enables scrolling of the view hierarchy included inside it. Only one direct child may be inserted within a scroll view. To add several views within the scroll view, add a view group, such as LinearLayout, as a direct child and insert more views within that LinearLayout.
- Canva & Figma(UI Design): Learned how to utilise Figma for UI design using templates and UI concepts, colour schemes, and so on. Canva was used to create the logo.
- Git & GitHub basics(VCS): Version Control Systems were utilised to maintain code among teams; when one person published their modifications into the code, the other members may remotely apply those changes to their code, which improved our productivity.
- Password Validation: User passwords were validated to see if they were of min length 6
- Password Reset: Utilized a firebase feature to send user an email to reset password on click of forgot password
- RecyclerView: Very similar to a listview,however it offers more flexibility for providing a limiting window into a large dataset
- Flask API creation: Learnt how to convert a simple Machine Learning Model into an API using the Flask Microframework
- Deployment on Heroku: the Flask API that we created was then deployed using the heroku documentation and basic git commands
- Testing using Postman: The API deployed on Heroku was tested for conditions like 200ok, whether data was in json format etc
- YouTube API integration: The YouTube DataAPIv3 was integrated with the project using the Google Dev Console guide and YouTube Videos; the videos are shown using the user's API Key and Video ID.
